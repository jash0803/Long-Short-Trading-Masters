# Financial Asset Recommendation

## Overview

The asset recommender leverages a **hybrid recommendation pipeline** that integrates:
- **Collaborative Filtering (CF):** Uses customers' past buy transactions.
- **Content-Based Filtering (CB):** Uses asset features and profitability data.
- **Demographic Based Scoring:** Incorporates customer risk profiles and demographics.

A **Streamlit** frontend is provided to allow user interaction and parameter tuning.

## Dataset Source

This system is built upon the **FAR-Trans dataset**, a comprehensive financial asset recommendation dataset, provided by a European financial institution.

## Data Sources

1. **Customer Information**
   - File: `customer_information.csv`
   - Details: Contains customer identifiers, type, risk level, investment capacity, and timestamps.

2. **Asset Information**
   - File: `asset_information.csv`
   - Details: Contains ISIN, asset name, asset categories/subcategories, market identifier, sector, industry, and update timestamps.

3. **Transactions**
   - File: `transactions.csv`
   - Details: Contains customer transactions (Buy/Sell) with monetary values, units, channels, and market information.
   - Note: Preprocessed to use only "Buy" transactions as positive interaction signals.

4. **Limit Prices**
   - File: `limit_prices.csv`
   - Details: Contains profitability data (ROI), first/last dates, and extreme values for every asset.

## System Components

### 1. Data Loading & Preprocessing

- **CSV Loading:**  
  Load all dataset files assuming CSV formatting and UTF-8 encoding.

- **Preprocessing Transactions:**  
  - Filter to include only "Buy" transactions.
  - Sort by timestamp for proper train-test splitting.
  - Build a customer Ã— asset rating matrix using transaction counts.

- **Train-Test Split:**  
  - Use leave-one-out split for evaluation.
  - For each user, hold out their last transaction as test data.

### 2. Recommendation Pipeline

#### A. Collaborative Filtering
- **Matrix Factorization:**  
  - Use Truncated SVD with 5 components.
  - Compute latent factors for users and assets.
  - _Output:_ Predicted ratings for customer-asset pairs.

#### B. Content-Based Filtering
- **Asset Profile Building:**  
  - One-hot encode categorical features (category, subcategory, sector, industry, market).
  - Include profitability as a numerical feature.
  - Handle missing values with appropriate defaults.
  - _Output:_ Feature matrix for all assets.

- **User Profile & Scoring:**  
  - Build user profile as mean of their purchased assets' features.
  - Compute cosine similarity between user profile and all assets.
  - Handle cold-start with neutral scores.
  - _Output:_ Content-based similarity scores.

#### C. Demographic Based Scoring
- **Risk Profile Matching:**  
  - Map customer risk levels and investment capacity to numeric scores.
  - Compute weighted similarity between user demographics and asset categories.
  - _Output:_ Demographic scores for assets.

#### D. Hybrid Scoring
- **Component Weights:**  
  - Allow dynamic adjustment of weights for each component.
  - Weights can be set independently (no sum constraint).
  - Default weights: CF (0.4), CB (0.3), Demographic (0.3).

- **Score Combination:**  
  - Normalize each component's scores to [0,1] range.
  - Apply weighted combination.
  - _Output:_ Final composite scores.

#### E. Recommendation Generation
- **Filtering and Ranking:**  
  - Remove previously purchased assets.
  - Rank remaining assets by composite score.
  - Select Top-N recommendations.

### 3. Evaluation & Frontend

#### A. Evaluation Metrics
- **RMSE:**  
  - Compute on held-out test transactions.
  - Handle edge cases and insufficient data.

- **Precision@N & Recall@N:**  
  - Evaluate recommendation quality at specified N.
  - Robust handling of edge cases and errors.

#### B. Streamlit Frontend
- **User Interface:**  
  - Customer selection dropdown.
  - Component weight sliders.
  - Top-N parameter setting.
  - Evaluation metrics toggle.

- **Risk Assessment:**  
  - Interactive questionnaire for risk profiling.
  - Questions on risk appetite, investment expectations.
  - Automatic profile updates.

- **Recommendation Display:**  
  - Detailed asset information.
  - Formatted scores and metrics.
  - Profitability and price information.
